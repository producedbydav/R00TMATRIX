# R00TMATRIX
Interoperable onchain database for SEEDS compositions

SEEDS is a cc0 music samples project that started on main net in 2022. It has moved to Base with vol. 5 this spring and I've added a interoperable/extensible metadata contract called R00TMATRIX that turns the project into an open music protocol on Base.

SEEDS music is open for anyone to use and many songs/beats/etc get made and sent to me on a regular basis having been created from them in one way or another. 

But building onchain unlocks new mediums and new methods of collaboration. R00TMATRIX protocolizes the SEEDS project into an open onchain database that programaticly delivers key/tempo/etc across SEED numbers, static versions (open to other musician collaborators) and dynamic & programatic algos of those versions.

Dynamic returns a version that's controlled by me at random or on a whim and can become an extensible contract.

Creative versions are contracts available to be made by anyone that programaticly select versions for each SEED number.
